Download the patent and patent metadata from USPTO PatentsView - https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables

The codebooks use g_patent.tsv.zip, g_patent_abstract.tsv.zip, g_assignee_disambiguated.tsv.zip, g_inventor_disambiguated.tsv.zip, g_cpc_current.tsv.zip and g_location_disambiguated.tsv.zip

These zip files are too large to be put in the GitHub Repository

Thank you!
